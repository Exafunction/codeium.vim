                        Please note that if either of the ports are specified, only one 
			window will work with codeium. 
			That window can have as many buffers within it, but any other

                                                *g:codeium_virtual_text_priority*
g:codeium_virtual_text_priority
                        The priority used for Codeium's virtual text completions
                        in Neovim. This can control how completions appear when
                        multiple virtual text items are on the same line, such
                        as when using LSP inlay hints.

                        The priority can be set on a per-buffer basis by setting
                        the b:codeium_virtual_text_priority variable. If
                        neither of these are set, the default priority is 65535,
                        which will usually place it above any other virtual text.

                        The priority given to Codeium's virtual text completions
                        for the current buffer in Neovim. If not set,
                        g:codeium_virtual_text_priority is used.

                                                *codeium-i_<Tab>*
Codeium.vim defaults to using the <Tab> key to insert the current
suggestion. If there is no suggestion display, the <Tab> key will fallback
to any existing <Tab> mapping you have. This is bound to `codeium#Accept()`

SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING                             *codeium-highlighting*

Inline suggestions are highlighted using the CodeiumSuggestion group,
which defaults to a gray color. You can configure this highlight group for
your colorscheme in after/colors/<colorschemename>.vim in your
'runtimepath' (e.g., ~/.config/nvim/after/colors/solarized.vim).  Example
declaration:
>
        highlight CodeiumSuggestion guifg=#555555 ctermfg=8
